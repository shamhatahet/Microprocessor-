## Description
Features:
- Password input via keypad
- Access check and validation
- Servo motor control for locking/unlocking
- LCD in 4-bit mode
- Buzzer alert for incorrect access
- LED indication for correct/incorrect login attempts

This project utilises a 16x2 LCD to prompt the user to enter a 4-digit password using the keypad. If the password is incorrect, an "Access Denied, Try Again!" message is 
displayed, and the first red LED lights up. If another incorrect attempt is made, the second red LED lights up. At the third incorrect attempt, the third red LED lights up, 
and the user is locked out of the system. The red LEDS flicker and the buzzer buzzes simultaneously. When the correct password is entered, the green LED lights up, the 
servo motor rotates to its unlocked position, and an "Access Granted" message is displayed on the LCD. The user must press * to return the servo to its locked position.

## Tools Used
- MPLAB X IDE
- XC8 Compiler
- Proteus 8 for simulation

## How to Run
Open the project in MPLAB X, compile with XC8, and upload to PIC16F877A.
